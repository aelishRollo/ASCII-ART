1. Load the image's pixels to a 2D array

	I've now got a pixel array of RGBA values. When converting to the brightness number,
	I'll just use the RGBS and do nothing with the alpha value

2. Convert the RGB tuples of each pixel into a singular number representing brightness
	I'm going to use average for now: brightness = (R+G+B) / 3
	Later I'll also try RMS

3. Convert these brightness numbers into ASCII characters

4. Print the ASCII art!
